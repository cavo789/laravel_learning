# Debugging

## .env

For enabling / disabling the Debug mode, check the `/.env` file. Adjust the `APP_DEBUG` constant.

## dd for Die and Dump

```php
  $tasks = [];
  $tasks['1'] = 'My first task';
  $tasks['2'] = 'My second task';
  $tasks['3'] = 'My third task';
  $tasks['4'] = 'My last task';

  dd($tasks);   // Die and dump
```

will return

```log
array:4 [â–¼
  1 => "My first task"
  2 => "My second task"
  3 => "My third task"
  4 => "My last task"
]
```

## Listen executed queries

Just listen DB events... Put a code like here below in your `/app/routes.php` file:

```php
if (env('APP_DEBUG', false)) {
	DB::listen(function ($query) {
		echo '<pre>Query fired ' . $query->sql . '</pre>';
	});
}
```
