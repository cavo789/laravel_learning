# HTML

<!-- concat-md::toc -->

## Class xxx not found

```
Class 'Form' not found (View: .../resources/views/...)
```

This error occurs when the HTML helper of Laravel isn't installed.

To solve it, run the following instruction in a DOS session:

```
composer require laravelcollective/html
```
