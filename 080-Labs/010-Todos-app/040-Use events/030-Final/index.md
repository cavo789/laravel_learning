# Final code

Here is the final code of this second lab: [todos.zip](%URL%files/todos.zip)

<!-- concat-md::toc -->

## Install a fresh copy

1.  Start a DOS prompt
2.  Make sure Laravel is correctly install: type `Laravel -V`, if you see the Laravel Installer's version number (f.i. 2.0.1), it's fine.
3.  Install a fresh Laravel website: go to your public_html folder (i.e. where you wish create your website, can be `c:\development\my_sites` too if configured like this on your machine).
4.  At the prompt level, run `laravel new a_folder_name` (f.i. `laravel new app_todos`)
5.  Once the installation is done, go in that folder: type `cd app_todos` (i.e. your folder)
6.  Grab a copy of [todos.zip](%URL%files/todos.zip) and unzip the file (under DOS `"C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe" x todos.zip -aoa` i.e. extract with full path and overwrite existing files)
7.  Retrieve the name of the database to create:
    1.  Open with a text editor the file called `.env` present in the root of `app_todos`
    2.  Look to the `DB_DATABASE` variable, you'll find the name of the database for the application (by default, it'll be `todos`)
8.  Create a database with that name (`todos`) in your mySQL
    1.  At the prompt level, type `mysql -u root -p` (where root is the username)
    2.  When asking the password, just press enter (there is no password)
    3.  In the MySQL prompt, type `CREATE DATABASE todos;` and press Enter
    4.  Type `quit` for leaving MySQL
9.  Start the migration: `php artisan migrate:install`
10. Create tables: `php artisan migrate:fresh`
11. Add the authentication layer: `php artisan make:auth`
12. Add fake data: `php artisan todos:populate`
13. Run `composer require "laravelcollective/html"`
14. Install `composer require rap2hpoutre/laravel-log-viewer --dev`
15. This done, start artisan by starting `php artisan serve` on the DOS prompt.
16. With your browser go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/login` and make a login with `christophe@todos.com` for the email while `admin` is the password.
17. Then we can use the application: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
